; Glossary ///1

; Instant-repeat (1-char search)
; While Lightspeed is active, repeatedly pressing f/F/t/T goes to (or
; right before/after) the next/previous match (effectively repeats the
; last 1-character search with a count of 1). Pressing any other key
; exits from this "standby" mode; subsequent calls will behave as new
; invocations.

; Beacon (2-char search)
; An extmark positioned over an on-screen matching pair, giving
; information about how it can be reached. It can take on many forms; in
; the common case, the first field shows the 2nd character of the
; original pair, as a reminder (that is, it is shown on top of the
; _first_ character), while the second field shows a "target label"
; (that is possibly a "shortcut"). If there is only one match, the
; extmark shows the pair as it is, with a different highlighting (we
; will jump there automatically then).
; Beacons can also overlap each other - in that case, the invariant to
; be maintained is that the target label (i.e., the second/right field)
; should remain visible in all circumstances.

; Label (2-char search)
; The character needed to be pressed to jump to the match position,
; after the whole search pattern has been given. It is always shown on
; top of the second character of the pair.

; Shortcut (2-char search)
; A position where the assigned label itself is enough to determine the
; target you want to jump to (for example when a character is always
; followed by a certain other character in the search area). Those you
; can reach via typing the label character right after the first input,
; bypassing the second one. The label gets a different highlight in
; these cases.

; Endnotes ///1

; (1) This should be saved right here, because the repeated search might
;     have a match anyway.

; (2) This is in fact coupled with `onscreen-match-positions`, so it's
;     _much_ cleaner to implement the logic here than in `count`. In
;     that case, we would have to duplicate the whole logic of
;     transforming the input to the actual pattern (that might get
;     arbitrarily complex with future enhancements).
;     In the case of instant-repeating t/T, we _have to_ skip the first
;     match, else we would find the same target in front of us again and
;     again, and be stuck. Note that we could have solved that with a
;     simple increment of `count`, without any complex checks, because
;     when instant-repeating, we know that we should be right before a
;     match - but as we have already implemented this hack for
;     cold-repeat, it makes sense to let this handle instant-repeat too.

; (3) If the operation spanned beyond the first group, we clear
;     self.state.dot.in3, and will ask for input. It makes no practical
;     sense to dot-repeat such an operation exactly as it went ("delete
;     again till the 27th match..."?). The most intuitive/logical
;     behaviour is repeating as <enter>-repeat in these cases, prompting
;     for a target label again.
;     Note: `save-state-for-repeat` only executes on new searches - if
;     we're currently dot-repeating, then it won't overwrite the state,
;     we can safely get `self.state.dot.in3` for the previous value.
